# 🛒 E-commerce App — Cloud Native DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline on Kubernetes 
Welcome to our  DevSecOps journey! 💥 \
\
This project demonstrates how to build a DevSecOps pipeline that automates the deployment of our Cloud Native application onto a **Kubernetes cluster**☸️ hosted on AWS **EC2** instances. 

## 🤔 What kind of app are we deploying?
It’s a dynamic e-commerce web application 🛒 developed with:

🅰️ Angular 18 – for a fast, modern, and component-based frontend

🔥 Firebase – handling backend services like authentication, database, and hosting

- **SonarQube** for static code analysis

- **OWASP** Dependency-Check and **Trivy** for security scanning

- **Docker** for containerization

- **Kubernetes** for orchestration

☁️ **And guess what ?** All of that is configured and hosted on AWS EC2 instances
